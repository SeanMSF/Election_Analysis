# Election_Analysis
Project Overview
To assist Colorado Elections officals to interpret local election results with specific aims to:
1. Calculate total votes cast
2. Differentiate name and numberof candidates
3. Determine how many votes each candidate received
4. Determine percentage of total votes earned for each candidate
5. Determine winner of the election and save info to .txt file

-Resources-
election_results.csv
VS Code Version: 1.52.1
Python 3.9.1
MacBook Air (M1, 2020) running
MacOs Big Sur 11.0

-Summary-

- There were determined to be Total Votes of 369,711

-   Candidates running were: Diana DeGette Charles Casper Stockham, Raymon Anthony

- Diana DeGette: received 73.81% of the vote.
  Charles Casper Stockham: received 23.05% of the vote.
  Raymon Anthony Doane: received 3.14% of the vote

- Diana DeGette was determined to be the winner by a significant majority

- I observed/created one version of the code that reported an interesting mistake, which I have posted to GitHub. Pypollinprogress file showed the losing candidate as winner. Because code language wasn't wrong and it ran, I assume this occurred due to ordering of the commands within the code but I would be interested in exploring this further. 


Challenge Overview
To determine The voter turnout for each county, The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, The county with the highest turnout

Challenge Summary 
-------------------------
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

-------------------------
Best turnout: Denver
Vote Count: 306,055
Percentage of total: 82.8%
-------------------------


As I work through this an interesting example of code to see would be how to write the candidate/county breakdown and how to write that. I will also experiment with this and try to figure it out :0
